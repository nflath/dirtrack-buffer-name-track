;;; Commentary:

;;; dirtrack-buffer-name-track-mode causes your shell-mode buffers to reflect
;;; the working directory in their buffer name.

;;; Installation

;; To use this mode, put the following in your init.el:
;; (require 'dirtrack-buffer-name-track-mode)

;; This will be default turn dirtrack-buffer-name-track-mode on in all future
;; prog-mode buffers.  To enable it in a specific buffer, run
;; dirtrack-buffer-name-track-mode

;; It is quite convenient to have your shell buffers contain the name of the

;; dirtrack changes the working directory.
